Introduction
============

`plonesocial.core` provides shared functionality for the suite of plonesocial packages.

It has two install profiles:

- `minimal` will install several browser views that are re-used in plonesocial

- `default` extends `minimal` and additionally loads patternslib javascript and css bundles

If you want to use your own provided javascript and css, run only the `minimal` profile.
If you don't know what patternslib is, run the `default` profile.
